# Stock news sentiment analysis

This project scrapes news article headlines from [Finviz](finviz.com/) for a given stock ticker. The [nltk vader package](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html) is used for sentiment analysis on the headlines.

The average sentiment score is then visualised over time.
